## Software Engineer

I am a Full Stack Engineer and Senior Computer Science student at **Cal Poly Pomona**. Currently serving as the sole architect for a non-profit startup, I specialize in building cloud-native SaaS platforms where **strict data integrity** meets **modern UI/UX**.

My technical focus is bridging the gap between heavy backend logic and responsive frontend architecture. I build high-reliability systems using **.NET 9 (C#)** and **Azure**, while delivering complex user interfaces with **Vue.js 3** and the Composition API.

### What I'm Building

Currently, I serve as the **Sole Architect and Developer** for **Timekeeping**, a multi-tenant ERP and payroll platform designed to challenge commercial accounting software.

In this role, I own the full engineering lifecycle:

*   **Complex Frontend Architecture:** Building a reactive **Vue.js** interface with `Pinia` state management and a custom `Tiptap` visual email editor to empower non-technical users.
*   **Temporal Engineering:** Designing backend algorithms to handle sophisticated time calculations, including automated "Midnight Splits" for payroll and dynamic Daylight Saving Time adjustments.
*   **Cloud Infrastructure:** Managing Azure resources (App Service, Service Bus, SQL Database) and creating automated CI/CD pipelines via **GitHub Actions** for zero-downtime deployments.
*   **Financial Infrastructure:** Engineering high-performance API endpoints for on-the-fly **ACH file generation** and point-in-polygon tax jurisdictional analysis using `NetTopologySuite`.

### My Background

My path to engineering wasn't traditional. Coming from a background in Business Administration, I realized that the most interesting problems weren't in *managing* processes, but in *automating* them.

What started as writing custom scripts to optimize administrative workflows quickly evolved into a passion for software architecture. Today, I combine that business domain knowledge with deep technical expertise to translate vague requirements into production-ready software.

### Connect With Me

I am graduating in **May 2026** and looking for **Software Engineering** opportunities where I can solve complex technical challenges. While I am open to various domains, I have a particular passion for **Open Source** and **Privacy-Focused** software.
