## About Me

My path to software engineering began during my time as an administrative assistant, where I discovered a passion for coding while developing custom functions for Google Sheets. I taught myself how to write custom functions and discovered that I really enjoyed it. Shortly after, I enrolled in my first programming course at RCC.

I am now pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona with an expected graduation in Spring 2025.

I'm also currently working as a Full Stack Software Engineer Intern, where I get to experience working on production-level projects.

## Connect With Me

I am always open to connecting with professionals, mentors, and potential collaborators in the tech industry. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss technology, potential opportunities, or share ideas.
