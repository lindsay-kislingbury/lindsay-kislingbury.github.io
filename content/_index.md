## Software Engineer

I am a Senior Computer Science student at **Cal Poly Pomona** and the **Full Stack Engineer** for a nonprofit startup. I specialize in architecting cloud-native SaaS platforms, automating complex business logic, and building secure infrastructure using **C#, .NET 9, and Microsoft Azure**.

### What I'm Building

Currently, I serve as the **primary architect and developer** for **Timekeeping**, a multi-tenant ERP and payroll platform designed to challenge commercial accounting software.

In this role, I own the full engineering lifecycle:
*   **Backend Architecture:** Designing high-performance REST APIs and SQL schemas to handle complex financial transactions and ACH file generation.
*   **Cloud Infrastructure:** Managing Azure resources (App Service, Service Bus, SQL Database) and creating automated CI/CD pipelines via GitHub Actions.
*   **Geospatial Engineering:** Building custom GIS engines using `NetTopologySuite` to perform point-in-polygon tax jurisdictional analysis.

### My Background

My path to engineering wasn't traditional. Coming from a background in Business Administration, I realized that the most interesting problems weren't in *managing* processes, but in *automating* them.

What started as writing custom scripts to optimize administrative workflows quickly evolved into a passion for software architecture. Today, I combine that business domain knowledge with deep technical expertise to build software that solves real-world operational problems.
